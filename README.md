Project Description:
Project 1 of the GA Immersive clas. This takes places during my 3rd week of class (Mary 3rd, 2021). I picked to do a UNO theme Memory Card game. 

**List of Features/requirements**

Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS
Properly link Javascript file and CSS file to HTML
Be able to open HTML page in browser
In javascript, use DOM manipulation
Monday 5/3: Got my HTML semantic up and linked my JavaScript and CSS files. Time to pick a game. Decided to go with Memory Game. Worked on my CSS set up and color. Used Flexbox for the the Score table. After reading a couple of examples, decided to build the card deck on a separate JavaScript file. Asked for help on how to link the second JS file to my HTML. Worked on getting the deck up and running all afternoon and part of the night. The video I saw in youtube on how to build a card deck is the following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRwIZWjLtE
Tuesday 5/4: After spending so much time trying to get the deck of cards fucntioning properly in my javascript, I decided to go with pictures instead afraid I was going to run out of time. Went through some examples and videos how to create the game board for a memory game. This involved a lot of DOM manupulation. References I used were: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/ and https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript. 
Wednesday 5/5: AM - Spent time trying to get the game board to work. Searched for the meaning and fucntionlity of different functions the references had. Learned a lot from the different sites I visited today. MDN and W3 schools especially. Also used the CSS tricks to make my CSS page to look better. Got the gameboard to work in the afternoon. Started working on my Scorebox. Got the strikes to work but not pertfectly. 
Thursday 5/6: Page is looking pretty good. Continue to work on my scorebox (used the example referenced https://cardmatch.surge.sh/). Trying to get the Wins going as well as the timer which it will be ideal. 
Friday 5/7: Presentation Day!
