Game Choice: Flash-cards
Game Style: Memory Game

**I was able to create a repo on Monday 5/3 however I wasn't able to push and thought I was adding and committing on Tuesday but I was getting errors. Decided to start from scratch on 5/5.**

Project Description:
Project 1 of the GA Immersive clas. This takes places during my 3rd week of class (Mary 3rd, 2021). I picked to do a UNO theme Memory Card game. 

**List of Features/requirements**

Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS
Properly link Javascript file and CSS file to HTML
Be able to open HTML page in browser
In javascript, use DOM manipulation
Monday 5/3: Got my HTML semantic up and linked my JavaScript and CSS files. Time to pick a game. Decided to go with Memory Game. Worked on my CSS set up and color. Used Flexbox for the the Score table. After reading a couple of examples, decided to build the card deck on a separate JavaScript file. Asked for help on how to link the second JS file to my HTML. Worked on getting the deck up and running all afternoon and part of the night. The video I saw in youtube on how to build a card deck is the following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRwIZWjLtE
Tuesday 5/4: After spending so much time trying to get the deck of cards fucntioning properly in my javascript, I decided to go with pictures instead afraid I was going to run out of time. Went through some examples and videos how to create the game board for a memory game. This involved a lot of DOM manupulation. References I used were: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/ and https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript. 
Wednesday 5/5: AM - Spent time trying to get the game board to work. Searched for the meaning and fucntionlity of different functions the references had. Learned a lot from the different sites I visited today. MDN and W3 schools especially. Also used the CSS tricks to make my CSS page to look better. Got the gameboard to work in the afternoon. Started working on my Scorebox. Got the strikes to work but not pertfectly. 
Thursday 5/6: Page is looking pretty good. Continue to work on my scorebox (used the example referenced https://cardmatch.surge.sh/). Trying to get the Wins going as well as the timer which it will be ideal. Update at 3 PM: Got the wins to work and fix the glitch on the strikes thanks to Casey! Next target is the timer. 
Friday 5/7: Presentation Day!

How did you plan your project?

After looking at the game choices, I was between doing flash cards or trivia. I used to like playing memory game when I was little with physical cards so in memory of that, my choice was made. 
The first thing I did was to create my files, html, css and js and linked them. After that, I began working on my HTML. Used divs for score table and game table in the body. Created multiple divs for each card placeholder, however later I learned I didn't have to do that so I got rid of them to simplify my HTML file. I started working on my CSS after my HTML was set up. Chose my font in google fonts and searched for different ways to make the color of my background and came accross the linear gradient which fades the color and you can choose different positions that the color starts fading. Got my CSS to look decent and then started working with JavaScript (JS). JS was where I needed the most help with. I started by creating variables for my different divs and started googling for different ways to set up a gameboard for a memory game. Watched a video in youtube on how to create a card deck and tried that first. After seeing so many references from MDN, stackoverflow and W3 schools, I applied them to my JS however I came to a block where I just couldn't get anything working. On the second day (Tuesday), I decided to get rid of the card deck and go with pictures afraid I was going to run of time. Added my pictures to the card array in my JS and came accross two useful sites that I liked how their memory game was set up so I applied the code to what I had and it finally worked on the third day (Wednesday). Wednesday I had my gameboard up and running. I started working on my scorebox for the strikes, wins and timer. Got the Strikes working however it was also counting the matches so it wasn't working properly. On Thursday, moved to work on the Wins however I coudn't get it work properly at the beggining so I seeked help from Casey. Casey showed me how to get it done. Began working on the timer but haven't finished. 

What did you learn?

Applied the different techniques we learned in class and used the references given to us. Put my learning into practive. I was missing a lot of things so the references got me to where I wanted to be. Learned about cool functions that I mentioned below and I know I will used in the future and different CSS properties that make the look of my page better. 

What are you most proud of?

I'm proud that my first project was not a disaster and at least I have something to present to you today. I like how it looks and how it functions. 

What would you do differently?

I would have liked to implement the deck of cards, have a start button and refresh button. 

What would you do next?

As my learning progresses, fix my timer and get the deck of cards going first and then maybe do a Super Mario game....sky is the limit!

Some new cool functionality and properties I learned during this project and I know it will be very useful in the future:

daataset property = provides read/write access to a custom data attribute to allow exchange of information.
localStorage = allows to save key/value pairs in a web browser. Data will not be deleted when the browser is closed. 
backface-visibility = CSS propery sets if the back face of an element is visilbe or not (choice between visible or hidden) to user upon page load.
transform = CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew or translate an element. 
transition = CSS property enables to define the transition between two states of an element. Choices: transition property, transition duration, transition timing, transtion delay.
innerHTML = property sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element.
